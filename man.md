# NAME

tt - A terminal based typing test

# SYNOPSIS

usage: tt \[OPTION\]... \[FILE\]

# DESCRIPTION

  By default tt creates a test consisting of 50 randomly generated words from
  the top 1000 words in the English language. If provided with a path, tt will
  use the given file as input treating each paragraph as a separate segment of
  the test. The program will automatically keep track of your position in the
  file so subsequent invocations on the same path will place you at the most
  recent paragraph (-start 0 can be used to reset your position).  
  
  Arbitrary text can also be piped directly into the program to create a custom
  test. Each paragraph of the input is treated as a segment unless '-multi' is
  supplied in which case each paragraph is treated as a separate test.

# EXAMPLES

Creates a series of tests each consisting of a random quote drawn from the
builtin quote file 'en'.
```
tt -quotes en
```

Creates a series of tests each consisting of 10 random words drawn from
words.txt
```
tt -words words.txt -n 10
```

Starts a sequence of tests in which each test consists of a paragraph from war
and peace starting with paragraph 1.
```
tt ~/war_and_peace.txt -start 1
```

Produces a test consisting of 40 random words draw from 
the system dictionary (similar to 'tt -n 40').
```
shuf -n 40 /usr/share/dict/words|tt
```

Starts a test consisting of two randomly drawn quotes from api.quotable.io and
prints the output of each test to STDOUT in csv format.
```
curl https://api.quotable.io/quotes|\
    jq '[.results[]|.text=.content|.attribution=.author][:2]'|\
    tt -quotes - -norreport -csv
```

Starts a new typing test which uses the tt source as input:

```
curl -LsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lemnos/tt/master/src/tt.go | head -n 20 | tt -noskip -raw
```

Modify to taste.

  /etc/tt/words\
  /etc/tt/themes

# KEYS

  **right** Move to the next test.\
  **left** Move to the previous test.
